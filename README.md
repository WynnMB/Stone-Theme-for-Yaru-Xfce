# Yaru-Stone Theme

A modified version of the **Yaru-olive** theme, with all greens replaced by greys — providing a neutral color option that Yaru doesn’t include by default.
The matching icon theme is a mashup of the Yaru-sage theme and the outdated gray theme from https://github.com/Jannomag/Yaru-Colors. I replaced as many icons as possible with the gray ones and left the rest as sage, since sage is the closest color to grey.

## Requirements

* The **primary Yaru theme** must be installed before using this color extension.
* Tested on **Debian 13 (Xfce 4.20)**.

## Installation

1. **Download and unzip** the theme folders from the releases page.
2. **Move** the extracted folders to the system theme directories using the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo mv Downloads/Yaru-stone /usr/share/themes
   ```

   ```bash
   sudo mv Downloads/Yaru-stone-dark /usr/share/themes
   ```

    ```bash
   sudo mv Downloads/Yaru-stone-icons /usr/share/icons
   ```
    
```bash
   sudo mv Downloads/Yaru-stone-dark-icons /usr/share/icons
   ```

## Recommended Window Manager Themes
