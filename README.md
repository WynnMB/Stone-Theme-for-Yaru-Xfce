# Yaru-Stone Theme

A modified version of the **Yaru-olive** theme, with all greens replaced by greys — providing a neutral color option that Yaru doesn’t include by default.

## Requirements

* The **primary Yaru theme** must be installed before using this color extension.
* Tested on **Debian 13 (Xfce 4.20)**.

## Installation

1. **Download and unzip** the theme folders.
2. **Move** the extracted folders to the system theme directory using the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo mv ~/Downloads/Yaru-stone /usr/share/themes
   sudo mv ~/Downloads/Yaru-stone-dark /usr/share/themes
   ```

## Recommended Window Manager Themes

This theme pairs well with the following **xfwm4** themes:

* **Daloa**
* **Kokodi**
