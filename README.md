This is a modified version of the Yaru-olive theme. I just changed all the colors from greens to greys, because Yaru doesn't include a neutral color theme.
You must have the primary Yaru theme install before this color extension can be used.

I tested it with Debian13-Xfce4.20.

To install download and unzip the theme folders.
Then run
sudo mv Downloads/Yaru-stone /usr/share/themes
sudo mv Downloads/Yaru-stone-dark /usr/share/themes

This theme goes well with the Daloa or Kokodi xfwm4 theme.
